 That is the only thing I'm doing. Yeah, but can you just like, oh wait, you... I don't know. Oh, there. Wait, wait, I'm getting an error. I received I-Like-Pie.
 I didn't do it. Wait. Wait, aren't you? What the fuck is this shit? It's gonna translate that.
 But this alone ...
 Part said, I will send an email to Arvent to remind him to finish the project by this Friday.
 Let's do a white evenly.

 I don't know. The class part is in the class schedule. Classified what he said is schedule. Interesting. Wait, and you translate it? Oh, I translated it.
 Oh, what is it? Oh.
 Translation? No, like, it used that trick. Like, what does that mean?
 Voy a enviar un email a Jason sobre el proyecto que está due tomorrow.
 Oh, oh, oh, we actually made an email. No, I didn't say English. No, you don't, you don't, you. Oh, you actually did it. Oh yeah, I said I'll get CTX in English. Done.
 میرے کو e-mail bhajnai Jason ko project ke baare mein.
 What are the logic of returning to the capital? Oh, like the context of people? I think it's creating the context, but it doesn't create the context. This one. Please send an email to Perth about his project that he didn't finish. Oh, that's not the same web search. that's right to the work. Do you have a doctor? I just do much talk to him. Also, never ask me about the indicate. Okay, so open your mouth. Is there something for opening legs? We put in the info that we would need to have make her... Corpus Phyllic, so now we have an email on Yeah, now we have to move on to the ass like I think you need to be able to make credentials. No, you don't need to make it. Oh, I sent it to you, but not to her. Oh, is it the same one? Exactly, they are the same. And where? In server. Yeah, credential to the LJS. Make it. All right, send it to Argon to you. You go to the same time so you'll think of something bug out later. Okay. What the fuck? Why do you make a sad face? The wrong one of the leaders. You're gonna do that. What is the subject? Because it's sung. Als je daar weer een nerf is, dan geten we er al daar. about the project that is due. You know what I mean? so lets click this one we go... Project that is due tomorrow. Right an email to part about his project due tomorrow. Yeah. Maybe anyone could want to pick up the phone. Wait, no, no, wait. Oh did the previous one do it? It didn't, I don't I never outlanded it Wait, is it writing to you guys? Oh wait. Take your drugs. but I can't, so it's using user email, take your time. It's using user email. User email, yeah, that's mine. As a fire. Go up a bit, go up a little bit. No, I'm not that terminal. Okay. Don't mind. lets try that Do anything with it. Oh! Okay. Yeah. So go to server listen. Server listen. So basically so far it made everything and I think it returned to the JSON result. But then you're not doing anything with the JSON result. It's completely expected. You need to call. Oh, not in the client I think you need to call. Like when you in the client, when you receive it again. Well no, she's not sending it to the client at all. Like if you need to send that to the client. Okay, so now we're going to send the JSON result to the client. Okay. And the client will then make an act agent handler in the client. Okay. I was saying 2 years is probably not that flashy. Yeah, so another thing to consider is when we're showing to, it's the only one we'll have time to show to. Exactly, so why do you two do this? Like, let's start doing the stupid thing. Is an image done really necessary in... It's just cool. I mean, we can just show a demo. And the demo is just like really sped up, so you can show that we have a demo. I feel like this is your motivation. It should be live, 100%. No, but we should also have a video, because there's no way we're going to show all of these. We should have the opening links thing, at least. Like the widget that shows up. The opening links, and then there's also like, clarified. It should be like, corpus search and web search. Yeah. I think opening links is fine. So opening links, we need to make a links vector store. Parapide. It's all opening and clarified will not be hard. I think we're like very similar to email in terms of like the server side L alone step. The only difference will be the client side step. But I think these two are very easy client side. They're just opening links. So that should be very easy. So I think these two will not be hard to implement. I don't think we should do two do's at all. I just ignore it. Okay, that's fine. I think it's a very low value and very high effort. We can do it at the end. We can deprioritize it. Now calendar schedule, I'm just kidding. So calendar scheduling, what do you guys think? How high value do you think it is? Like can we say it only in? I think that's cool. Wait, remember last time that's how the ReefLux guys were like, holy shit, added into your calendar right then and there. I saw it in the live, they're like checks everyone's calendar. No, no, just straight added. Yeah. I think, like if you have a Gmail logic, then like a Shenzhen too hard, so I just, like, you can copy. You shouldn't even base it in the business. Then can we copy the byte by the logic for checking? Because that would be how it looks like. That would be how it looks like. Yeah, it's checking. Like just scheduling. What is the library logic do? I don't remember. It checks everybody's schedules and when it's busy or not, right? Yeah, check everyone's schedule. File. That would be really fucking cool if you could do that. Like, oh, can you find a time when we're both free tomorrow for a meeting or something, right? But that didn't take an LL on it, but it just did something like. I don't think we even implemented it. Oh, it's fine. As long as the calendar event shows up, it's fine. One of the things that doesn't have that base in the era, I don't know. I think they say that it checks the default. Yeah. Because there has a conflict and then you send it in with other, does this pretty complicated? All right. Do we want to do it or not? Yeah, I think so. I think that's... And then what's the fourth one we want to put on for now? I think it's done. Oh, wait, so you think, okay, slack. It's a clarifies like answering questions. Like, if you have a question. Yeah, it's a clarifies like, if someone asks a question, we search over a knowledge purpose and we do a web search at the sound deck. What emotions it would be like, can you like what a... The problem would be like... Oh, it would be like... Can we generate a mock-up of what this might look like? We had stars and the sky together as one. Oh. Can we get over it? Uh oh. What are the things you have seen in the meeting that you want a month ago? And we should verify that like actually I think the use case is lower there. I think the coolness is higher there. I mean, they're gonna feel like they'll see through that. Like, they'll do it. Actually, yeah. Okay, we also, yeah, we all the focus like should sense this entire promise. Still don't understand it. Like I don't understand. Like I don't think they would be able to explain it to a judge in two minutes. Okay, let's put a table on image gem. I can code such as how it's like. So we can do this one more. One minimum and like I think it should take like two hours for each of us to do one I can't we should be able to do multiple it should paralyze So what's the last one you guys are interested in Cool, these are all fine, but they're very fine. Wait, can we do something with like multilingual stuff? You do multilingual. Support, I mean yeah. Already supported. Okay, go ahead. You don't know how we support it, but we support it. There are things specifically to like, a sweeter product, like meetings, like that would be useful. That's co-cursor. I'm gonna highly making a slideshow. I think it's much of a dream. I based on what I'm talking it creates. That's really hard. Some rude images have been a lot of... What about you don't tend to make a slide? That's really expensive. Have you ever done for an advertisement? Why would you just talk about advertising? It seems not. I wish I could have a slice of it. You can judge it if you see it like monster-y. I think that's it. It's just like the case you're just doing. What's the problem with the image and with it for a slide? I don't know if I'm gonna say that. I feel like it. Oh it's fine. The question is like what is the sample probably? What sort of like, can you make us, let's make us lie to that? Like what is that exactly in tail? Oh, like let's say we're brainstorming about some things like, what do you think this could look like? Let's put it on the slide. Tell me, why? The reflex channel, the guy said hi everyone, we were back at the booth. There have been zero messages except for the guy in the channel. Oh, maybe there are people in person. Brown is in there. Oh! So works. We got it. Please send an email to Parth about our project due tomorrow. I'm going to send an email to Parth about our project due tomorrow. I'm sending an email to Parth about my what the I need to write an email to Parth about the project you tomorrow. Okay, we're done. And then data return. We're done, isn't it? Wait, let's think again.
