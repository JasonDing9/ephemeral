Jason said:  So you want a lot more information, right?
Jason said:  Where are you constructing the notification on your end? Yeah.
Jason said:  I feel like the notification like for email for example should be that complicated I feel like you should be like email too drafting subject that like I don't really need to actually show the email there
Jason said:  So there's an information I need.
