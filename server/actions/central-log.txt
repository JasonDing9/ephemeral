Parth said:  Okay, I'll go ahead and send an email to Jason tomorrow asking him about signing the lease. How does that sound?
Parth said:  I'm going to be meeting you at 2pm tomorrow to follow up if that sounds good.
Parth said:  I mean, it just inferred the wrong things. Like, the least thing became a calendar discussion of signing Lees.
Parth said:  What? Jason's doing too much. Jason part least discussions. That's crazy. Even had it in a muggy. It's so stupid. Follow me. So I think they're both meetings.
