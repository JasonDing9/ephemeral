Ayushi said:  we had hopes for more than...
Ayushi said:  We're putting the ribbon on what we have.
Ayushi said:  front end
Ayushi said:  there... unclear... writing... What are you guys doing? Are you even up on night? No, I went home at like 11 and then I came back...
Ayushi said:  Shit my computer just changed to a light mode.
Ayushi said:  Oh god Yeah, you came back one like 8 p.m. And then I tried staying here until then but
Ayushi said:  all the codes so complex. Like, we had everything like last night, I was so happy with where we are right, because it was like, we actually had basically the entire machine running pipeline now, because I fixed everything. And this one dude added like, unnecessary writing to everything. Because he thought he'd be intelligent and optimize it. Now, now I can't debug anything, because if I want to put the prompts, he's chained it in a way that like he, like it's the length of like whatever some output doesn't match exactly what he's expecting, he's just repeating the entire thing all over again. So then, so now if I change the prompts and something goes wrong even slightly, like the entire thing just breaks, it just crashes. Oh god. So, whatever dude, like I kind of just gave up, I'll always use the idea to separate hackathon like with a different team. Like, was these people still building or are they asleep now? I don't know what the fuck they're doing. It was kind of just love. Just so that it's
 all dead.
Ayushi said:  Well, we'll get points back. We just tell him, we'll just tell him. Maybe you just did it for Shutton Giggles, so it seems like he finalized it real fairly. No, I think that's a little bit bad. I think once you split the regret, yeah. And it's quite accepted immediately.
Ayushi said:  Yeah, yeah, you know the one that's like Diana, right? You don't know what I'm talking about? This one?
Ayushi said:  Yeah, no, we just need coffee beans. That's it. What is it? Oh, okay, so it's like not an intuitive what this is, but essentially.
Ayushi said:  This is the second background.
Ayushi said:  I'm gonna put the product in the background.
Ayushi said:  I was just talking what is this like this is the project No, this is not the one. This is the M on's website It's not the one that I think it is Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is the project Basically it just like listens to you and it does This is the worst explanation I've ever heard already Wait, that's literally what it does Okay, we're going to explain Okay, have you ever watched you have another you? Yeah, the slot is crossed all over our heads countless times We find ourselves swamped and too many fast Unable to keep up as information flies over our head or something else Now our goal is to build an autonomous agent that can be that person for you An AI that learns from your interactions and proactively takes actions and gives you insights Sitting in on meetings calls anywhere you have your computer out Okay, that's a form of page Basically what I did is like it's an agent that listens in I'm like whenever you're when you're meeting or something like I'll call it Listen to what you're doing and t
hen based on that can proactively take actions associated with what you're saying So if you're talking about like The draft of the entire email and put it in your Gmail draft folder If you want to schedule a meeting with someone like hey, let's follow up on this at 5 p.m. For now it'll put it on your calendar without anything else you're saying that in your meetings Wait, how do you add them in integration? Like like Wow That sounds like a lot The other two main integration were like one was like clarification So it's like the search is over and existing like say you're confused about something in a meeting and you're asking a question about it It'll just give you notification on the side page because the answer to what you were confused about by searching over an existing knowledge base or the internet like a Google search
Ayushi said:  Oh, well, if you're talking about Gmail and like they have their VPI just like you have to do the maxis. You cannot authenticate. We have to authenticate your Gmail and your
Ayushi said:  We can persist to refresh token so that you never need to do it again. And I'll just constantly run my background. Oh god, it already, we scheduled a meeting. Fuck. Oh, it's not here. She scheduled like 100 meetings on our Google calendars. And of course, something like that. Yeah. Oh yeah. So we also like say, it has to know what to do based on like, what you're saying, right? Like how does it decide like, oh, can I get a little V.A. Could I do this? We have, we trained this classifier. It's a simple narrow network, okay? Yeah. So like based on what you're saying, it's like, shouldn't you do something out of one of these actions, which they do nothing at all.
Ayushi said:  I was a random kid. We ended up dropping a schedule in from the classifier and just schedule it, they say the word schedule. He said it like 10 times it's over, bro. I have to do it. I'm gonna delete all of you. I'm gonna get emails now. So that's all that stuff. And the last, the coolest part in my opinion is basically you have a shadow agent going, uh, sitting on the meeting too. And basically what you can do is like at any point in the meeting you can be like, hey assistant, uh, what are your thoughts on this? Or can you explain this to us or keep your focus or if something were missing or like can you summarize what we just said in last five minutes? And this assistant is listening on your confirmation conversation that's transcribed all your recent, uh, like it's transcribed on your entire conversation so it can do a rag or it can just look at the most recent thing. Take that in this context and do it to language law and language law can answer that question because it has a world context. 
So you can just be like, hey assistant, can you explain multi-grading thoughts? I know, like explain multi-grading to you like not be a text, be a speech. It'll just say it out loud as a part of the meeting. Uh, and simultaneously it proactively on the side every like 10, 15 seconds based on what you guys are saying. It suggests like, hey you might want to talk about this next or here's, uh, uh, a suggestion for what you should, you could have done better or like if it's nearing the end of the conversation, it'll say maybe you should schedule a time to follow up and actually stuff like that proactive agents on the side. So that, I think that that shadow agent that works in the background all the time with the cool aspect for me.
Ayushi said:  Oh strong.
Ayushi said:  So this is an image-centered, interesting. How long did it take for you to add the integrations to everything? Because I feel like that is to have something that can just arbitrarily control your desktop like that is really cool. See, integrations don't actually take that long. Because we have worked with a lot of these APIs and past-talked it on, so we could like...
Ayushi said:  So the APIs were not hard to work with, and you knew what beer jang was. Oh, uh...
Ayushi said:  Integrations with the heart part first, right? What was the heart part?
Ayushi said:  We also had some multi-threading bullshit by then. So basically, how it works is that each of us can run this on our computers locally and all clients. But the logic all happens on a single server, so I'm gonna be her, she's a server. And so, our audio is SCP to over to her computer, and then she runs all this. No, audio is processed on your computer. The audio is processed to text, the text is SCP to over to her computer. She processed it on server-side logic, and then she SCPs a result back to us. Like, then I'd be parameter to the API call, and then we make the API call to client side. And the idea of all this was that you could do multi-threading, but everyone in a meeting could be saying something. And the AI would be suggesting things for each of them individually to do. So that was the hardest part, honestly. Oh, letting all that up. Okay, cool.
Ayushi said:  Yeah, you didn't surprise me or something. Look at that one. Look. How does it learn from the environment it's in? Like you're...
Ayushi said:  Keeps a log of everything you said and that's what provides a context for like me. That's right. It's not. I'm gonna log it like I mean well you can you you don't pass the entire log you post the most you pass the window.
Ayushi said:  sliding the note or it can be like the most similar things based on like embedding search because we also mentioned a vector short. Oh, okay, yeah, that makes sense.
Ayushi said:  I don't think it's like more practical. Can you just use the most recent stuff? Yeah. You look like a little dumb. I think it's only way too that easy. No, it's only that, it's only dumb. Did I count fine then? Are one can you find it? The... Am I a code? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's not because it's probably just like a G-A-C-A-G-A-F. And G-A-F or something. I can't call it here and I try to inspect the element in it and I just don't know what...
Ayushi said:  괜찮나?
Ayushi said:  I think judging so early last year is due like 11 since you had nine. Yeah, it's like three hours long, too. Okay? It's outside. Judging is outdoors. Oh, rainy. Why? It looks pretty funny, but it's kind of dumb. It's probably better for ventilation anyway.
Ayushi said:  I'm going to go home tomorrow. Yeah. And not today. Today. Yeah. Yeah. And not today. Today. Yeah.
Ayushi said:  I don't know, I probably can't see it. I'll see you in the next video. No, I'll pop it up to you. Are you not even gonna go? I don't know, I think it's just fucked up beyond belief. Like that, yeah. We'll see. See you. Bye. See you. Do you find it arvind? No, I'm just trying to inspect all of it. Oh, you don't have to re-flow. Oh, that's a validation that people can be a crossbar.
Ayushi said:  But judges are probably just like, oh yeah, every other hacker can do it.
Ayushi said:  But yeah, a lot of integrations is like impressive. I don't have four. It's just the way you say it. It makes me sound like mull-on more. Like the draft is automatically in their drafts folder. You know, it's the same thing. That's why the live demo is so critical to how we... The demo is going to be so... But that is what will... All right, we're coming up on code 3, do you just want to do two? Where are you guys up? Oh, I don't know how to edit this. You can't implement the files I have.
Ayushi said:  So we can use something instead of a draft. That should be pretty easy. But where are you sending a crop? So you can use all of this stuff? Yeah, you can. Okay. Yeah, you can be able to just change it from draft to like send one. Okay.
Ayushi said:  I'm not going to do my works. And I also changed it so I only use the most recent set of suggestions because they refer to every 10 seconds. So suggestions are done. I think I just need to fetch the ice if you want to help read the ice. And Jason's finishing his meme generation and I'm starting the death post. Hey, should we push your most recent stuff? Hmm. What craze should be the like sector meme generation? And with that, the 2024 season comes to an end.
Ayushi said:  Could you please give me that. That would be some thing Christy, with God Passing images of white trim
Ayushi said:  خاص سے مسجر کی تراجا لگی نہیں ہوагا
Ayushi said:  Is your mom in? For fun? Well, she is body there. Okay. We live there? Oh, there's your mom friends there. We are in the mom. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that makes me... You have a new interviewer right now, I'm in my mom. I don't know. It's a best job. Pacific Northwest. Oh, yeah. We are the fuck you are. I didn't find this. I think we're in the room. Oh, it's okay. I'm going to give others a line. So... I really like my intro. Did you guys like it? I remember what you had in other youth. No, I don't know about another youth. Wait, I like that. Pitch it high. Because it's made to it seem like everything is higher, even if it's not pitch it high. Okay. Sure.
Ayushi said:  Hello, can you schedule?
Ayushi said:  Oh my god, look at this. Why is this entire thing showing up here?
Ayushi said:  Let's me see if you can. I dropped in Dimes and this is a dead post. You got it buddy. Wait, what are you gonna be finished? So we can film. Sure. I haven't seen the suggestions, pain getting updated. Have you been running client-pink? Oh fuck. I don't know, every 10 seconds you're on client-pink. Says the woman who wrote client-pink. Okay, when I wrote it, I remember it. No module named Google. Rod. Okay.
Ayushi said:  Wait, did you guys ever have to say something?
Ayushi said:  This is no module name Google It's on the it's on mailing dot pie No module name Google Where's that serving? Yeah, it's the one that sends an email Like I just see it into that oh fuck I'm in base
Ayushi said:  Okay.
Ayushi said:  We have it in the last two hours. We should decide what we're doing. What's the timeline? I hope we see. Like when I was a Q, I was able to adjust to the email thing. And I'm trying to see how it's in an image. I'm not super sure about that. Can you see me think I may have collected your bytes? And thendown. Son Kong image yeah!
Ayushi said:  I'm so sorry to do this last time. I'm so sorry to do this in a socket. Oh, the image through the socket. Okay, well I sent you like what you might want to follow. Here is a different one. You know, they just like have the, you know, open up the image. Yeah, wait, I don't think we need to send any more. I think just open the image. Yeah, we don't need the E-mob yes. Okay, are you doing start object drive? Yeah, I'm not. Okay, awesome. Can we, how long do you think we would take to film the video? I think she end up in an hour. Okay, so then we do that 730 to 830. Okay, I'll try to finish the depot by 730. I'm gonna try to finish the architecture by 730. I don't feel like eating anything but I'm really hungry. But I still don't want to eat because I'm hungry. I'm hungry. I'm hungry. I'm hungry. I'm hungry. I'm really hungry. I'm hungry.

Ayushi said:  Sorry, it is they
Ayushi said:  I'm going to make it more darker. I think background should be like that in light of color. Let me try to see how it would recolor an image. Because I like the animation, but yeah, you're right. It's too dark. I think we should go for gray light. Minimal looks good, but if there's something dark, it shows it's not just black.

Ayushi said:  I like that personally. I think the background could be a slightly lighter color, and then I would like even a little lighter blue. I don't know if it's perfect. Cheers!

Ayushi said:  Okay, I can't see it. Okay, good night. Just a little bit. Oh, there. I'll put it up. Oh. Okay, look. Can you hit the back on later?
Ayushi said:  This is better.
Ayushi said:  even lighter. Also can you do the, can you do the, the compressed view? How are we going to show it? Yeah.
Ayushi said:  I think I like it. You change that, that's a mighty thing. I like the waxing, I really like the little edge. It's too much. Maybe like a dark blue.
Ayushi said:  Here we try it passed, let's try another cube again,
Ayushi said:  I'm here in life.
Ayushi said:  Yeah, I feel like it would be like summer passing like a nice play.
Ayushi said:  Okay. This is okay. It's a jash. Can you open one of them? Just like, go to the dining room. Next, let's get in. Oh no, why didn't you open to a new town?
Ayushi said:  Thank you.
Ayushi said:  Oh, also the seconds is not accurate. No, no, no, no, I should. I mean, I would have had obeying closed-piece sliders.
Ayushi said:  yeah what you're laughing
Ayushi said:  Building there.
Ayushi said:  Why is this writing stuff so much harder than I remember? You got it buddy. Hey do we use light changes? I mean we did for the tags, but I'll go rid of it. I don't see a slider now. I'll do jumps. Hello? I didn't talk to my gson. Are you talking about stuffing? I don't know if you're interested in that.
Ayushi said:  Maybe this beach shit text library is it?
Ayushi said:  The text speech under score recognition powered by open a eyes And then what's text speech open a eyes TTS Cute
Ayushi said:  I think doing this lighter thing is a little bit difficult to do since. Like I'm just trying to see what would be worth the time. I think I want to fix the buttons.
Ayushi said:  Yes We are at one ninety four minutes. Let's get to 200 guys. Come on. Oh, we definitely will Langed chain Is not in our Oh It's there just didn't get in the car either
Ayushi said:  Using the chain. In fact, we're partnering with them. Put the logo on our project. You got our small partners with OpenAI. In fact, put Sam open's face on the project. Right next to you, she's... She got so confused, she had more of a few aborted sneeze. No, that was... That was a gag. Yeah, I was... No thing is sitting while I was talking. So... I think like fiber. But, um... 13 dollars? That's not fiber over it. What is fiber? It's a good example of fiber. Like broccoli. Actually, Costco has these like fruit and veggie patches. Patches? Patches. How do you like it? Like apples, those. They have. But they're all so broads. That's true.
Ayushi said:  So elegant, just looking like a wow. Looking like a wow. Thank you. Oh, this place is everywhere.
Ayushi said:  Can you quickly show me what the properties of this link says? Fuck these links. You wrote this. Check the link if I didn't write that shit.
Ayushi said:  Do you see this links thing? Do you remember you added links? Do you remember what the actual link is? It belongs to the fine agent of the cards.
Ayushi said:  You don't have a new S-lib J-S<|ko|> You don't have a new S-lib J-S<|ko|> I'm not going to sleep. Don't slip. The person who is in the classroom has the like the... like our digital diagram I like to make so quickly. I don't know why this is so difficult. If you haven't checked in yet, come to the desk now. What the fuck? They are garbage joking. There's a lot of garbage. Oh my god. It's hungry. It's hungry. Yeah, it's so bad. Holy shit, are we finished?
Ayushi said:  We haven't even tested it. And to add, we haven't tested it the same time. I don't know why. I'm gonna open the image in this server, computer, and we are sure. That's fine dude, fuck the image. We need to move on. We sunk three hours into the hits. We said you wanted a new agent. Yeah, but... It's from the meme. It's a valid, but we need to move on now. We're at TimeRetch. Open it. Never do nothing. Okay, do you fix the time thing? No. No, I know. Wait, yeah, screw architecture behind you, time folks. We need to record the video. That's the bigger blocker than the architecture diagram. I don't know why it keeps opening it when I... What are you working on at the moment? Did you put the link in the collapse and not on the thing itself? No, I put in the button. What's the button? Is it the link? Yeah, on click. But there is no click here. That's what I hate to click.
Ayushi said:  But not. Oh, I didn't know that. But what if you have the first news running the server to say cheers? So over here, it's been on there for a while. We would not have the brawl on us, but then clicking everywhere. Oh, anything out of it. Uh.
Ayushi said:  bum me킨 technicians We need a practice demo, it's better really. I had a defensive check everywhere it fails. Yeah. You're in a bad rush.
Ayushi said:  I'm gonna end it. If it's interesting enough, they'll see on their own. You gotta catch some of the first one. But also it's okay if some judges aren't interested. Oh, I fixed it. I'll do some testing, I'll try and try and make sure. It's not okay if some judges aren't interested. We're gonna win. We're gonna win. This looks fucking awesome. Look at this. Look at this. This is better than the orange. Our bar is already dead. Oh no, the thing, image is an extent, okay. Okay, so you can't see the suggestions. Wait, is the background like... Dynamic. Yeah, it is. I mean, it's not like the way you actually see it. It is moving. But I was like, am I losing it? It's like blank here, so you just don't see it. Yeah, yeah, we don't know how to make it. It's like, it's like, it's like, down for a little bit. What about this? No, the bar is not. It's a little, like, blue to the little letter. It's gonna be hard because the way we did later is not actually... Oh, it was just a side, it contains that point, 
it was seven times... No, you done as it was on that. It was good. Exactly, just make that 40% blue. Cheers. There's a better, no, this is darker. No, it's not actually that good in the direction. I kinda like that. I don't know what it's gonna be on this. Cheers. How's that?
Ayushi said:  I'm just going to ask you a question. Okay, oh yeah, how do I do? I push my thing, I'm just doing testing. It's not really anything works. I'm going to ask. Wait, I'm actually like, I'm not going to bother these MDs. Yeah, I'm going to do I'm MD. I'm not. I wish I was fat right now, bro. I don't have any fat in my system, all of my fat deposits are depleting. I know we've run this on that. I can't come up with the pace to be fucking dead. I'm going to climb that. Just talk to talk out loud, let's get in there. I'm going to go to the shed and leave the cells. This thought has dropped all of our heads multiple times. Countless times, we find it's a swamp in too many tasks. I'm able to keep up in meetings and information flies over our heads or... Coffee paste origin. Coffee paste origin, fucking coffee paste. Coffee paste and shit, bro. Jamie, coffee paste origin. You just use some of the origin. I'm actually tripping honestly. I'm nervous and I can't see it. Go walk out of this walk.
Ayushi said:  I wanted to leave as soon as I was a little bit. But I think it's three opportunities. It's so late. Dude, what if we just have Uber? 23 minutes. Huh? Yeah, if it's like three or four people. If it's like 20, I'll go. Like I'm not waiting till three. Who else would have in other groups that you can do with this in here? That I don't know. I feel like I'm moving to a few people probably. They probably want to stay. I don't think they're over about it. I think it's... Okay, but just ask three. How much would it be? It probably would be like 20 or 20. We're just wondering how much would be the over-bought, over-three. Because the way it went out three is like insane. That would bust up left right out. Wait, but the award's only ends after you. So it's your part. To leave before. What? Like I really have a scale too. You don't want to say? Do you have the awards? What the fuck are you coding here for? What if we don't get it, bro? I'm fucking code, so we get it. Okay, okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm
 very apologetic. Oh, I picked the background so it's continuous now. I want to change this to pins. Oh, you, what the fuck is this? What the fuck is this? Okay, okay. Okay, okay. Okay, okay. Can everyone open up the project up here?
Ayushi said:  I'll send an email to Paulus talking about the project later.
Ayushi said:  Yeah, I'll send out the email later just casual meeting tomorrow at 2PM.
Ayushi said:  Yeah, I'll send it email to part later today to skyddle another meeting next week.
Ayushi said:  1 tbc 1 tbc 1 tbc 1 tbc 1 tbc 1 tbc 1 tbc 1 tbc 1 tbc 1 tbc 1 tbc 1 tbc 1 tbc 1 tbc 1 tbc
Ayushi said:  The timing issue should be fixed. This... ...front-down looks like it's gonna be done.
Ayushi said:  I send an email to everyone better today to schedule another meeting.
