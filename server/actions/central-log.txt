Ayushi said:  Oh, good. Is it like set up? Right, where do I see it? Oh, like the... Classic. Agent, handler. Actually, classification. Alright, because we're operating that. I don't see anyone sleeping outside. Where is classified up? We need to make that Agent speak less. Just like in the prom, say, like, speak only speak one or two, say, continue. Because I feel like... Why is the... it's the Mistral on it. Can we just enforce it? Like, when... Open the... Assistant. Actual Agent, like, when the... Guides speak. When the Assistant speaks. Yeah. Speak less. Just like he's speaking about 30 seconds. Yeah, you won't cut it off there. You would cut it off. And where he gets his text from.

Ayushi said:  Yeah. What about setup or like setup like setup and be it in there? But what if it's like let's send them in email the set of the time? Well, yeah, in that case, it's just an email already. Yeah. So that's fine. It shouldn't be a game.
Ayushi said:  So I just removed the L-Sib statement for if the action is scheduled. Yeah. So can I return that instead? Yeah. Okay. So currently schedule is only scheduled. Oh, I think I guess if that's the end meeting.
